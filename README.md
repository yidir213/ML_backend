# Machine Learning Project Backend

This repository contains the source code for the backend of our machine learning project. The backend is responsible for handling data , model inference, and serving predictions.

## Note:
To explore the details of this project, please refer to the `views.py` file. It contains the main logic and API endpoints for interacting with the machine learning models.

## Testing with Frontend

To test the integration of this backend with the frontend, click [here](https://yidir-ml-project.netlify.app/). The website utilizes this backend for its functionalities.


**Flexibility:** The website is designed to handle different datasets not only the Iris dataset and is adaptable to multiple other machine learning classification models other than SVM.

### Note for First-Time Use of the [website](https://yidir-ml-project.netlify.app/)

If you're using the site for the first time, please allow a few moments for the initial server response. The server start up upon the first API call, so the initial access might take a bit longer as it initializes. Subsequent interactions will be more responsive once the server has started.
