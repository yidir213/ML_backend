# Machine Learning Project Backend

This repository contains the source code for the backend of our machine learning project. The backend is responsible for handling data , model inference, and serving predictions.

## Note:
To explore the details of this project, please refer to the `views.py` file. It contains the main logic and API endpoints for interacting with the machine learning models.

## Testing with Frontend

To test the integration of this backend with the frontend, click [here](https://yidir-ml-project.netlify.app/). The website utilizes this backend for its functionalities.


**Flexibility:** The website is designed to handle different datasets beyond the Iris dataset and is adaptable to multiple machine learning classification models beyond SVM.
